<h2> About me</h2>
<p> I have extensive experience in the financial/investments industry. I have worked as an "Investment Trader", "Investment Advisor" & "Trade Analyst" in recent years.
    During my time as a "Financial Professional", I got the opportunity to work with software engineers when working on a new side of the business, I go to experience the developing of new trading tools and websites, which sparked my interest in becoming a developer and be on the other side one day.
